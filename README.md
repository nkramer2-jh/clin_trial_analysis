# Simulated Clinical Trial: Blood Pressure Reduction with Hypothetical Drug

This project simulates a randomized controlled clinical trial in R to evaluate the effect of a hypothetical blood pressure–lowering drug. The script includes data generation, statistical analysis, and exploratory data analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## 🧪 Project Description

We simulate a clinical trial with 100 participants randomly assigned to either a drug group or a placebo group. Each participant has associated demographic and health information (age, sex, BMI). We simulate changes in blood pressure and perform statistical tests to evaluate drug efficacy.

## 📊 Features and Methods

- **Simulated patient data** including:
  - Age (normally distributed around 45)
  - Sex (randomly assigned Male/Female)
  - BMI (normally distributed around 30)
  - Group assignment: Drug or Placebo
- **Simulated outcome:** Change in blood pressure (`bp_change`), where the drug group has a greater average reduction.
- **Statistical analyses:**
  - Group summary statistics
  - Two-sample t-test to compare blood pressure change between groups
  - Linear regression modeling (`lm()`) to evaluate the influence of group, age, sex, and BMI
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
  - Converts categorical variables to numeric
  - Performs PCA on patient characteristics
  - Summarizes and plots explained variance

- `README.md`: Description of the project, goals, and methods

## 📈 Example Output

- **Summary statistics** show means and standard deviations for each group
- **t-test** returns a p-value indicating if the drug effect is statistically significant
- **Linear model** provides estimates for each predictor’s effect on BP change
- **PCA summary** shows how much variance is explained by each principal component
